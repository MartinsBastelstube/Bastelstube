# Bastelstube

Public resources from the projects in Martin's Bastelstube --> <https://bastelstube.rocci.net/>

Sorry -- all of my project descriptions on the linked website are written in German. But I'll be happy to translate them for you upon request. Just contact me using the email link.

Quick overview across all of my existing projects --> <https://bastelstube.rocci.net/projekte.html>
List of ideas for coming projects --> <https://bastelstube.rocci.net/soon2come.html>

These projects are not for sale. I just build the devices I need for myself. I publish the descriptions for educational purposes, so interested younger people can add some more stuff to their robotics controllers. You are free to build your own copies of these projects using my descriptions.
I don't promise that my descriptions are exhaustive or complete. Try out yourself, you might find that some details need to be tweaked a little bit differently in your environment.
Contact me if you need more detailed documentation, if you need support getting your own devices to work or if you want to share some remarks / criticism / improvement proposals.
